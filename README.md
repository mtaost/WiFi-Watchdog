# Wi-Fi Watchdog
Wi-Fi Watchdog is a project created for the Northrop Grumman Student Cybersecurity Challenge at the University of Maryland. The premise of the competition was to "Develop an application that utilizes machine learning and the provided Raspberry Pi Kit to meet today’s cyber needs"

Our project implemented a machine learning classifier to analyze network traffic and learn users based on the characteristics of their packet flow. Since everybody's device has a unique pattern of traffic that is more specific to the user than the device (such as what apps one has installed on their phone), we can create a specific classifier for each device. Using this information, Wi-Fi Watchdog is able to recognize the difference between users of different devices on the network without being explicitly told after the training period. Consequently, Wi-Fi Watchdog is able to recognize when an unauthorized user connects with a new device, as opposed to an existing, familiar user connecting with a new device. 

This project won second place in the competition among 9 other teams for a prize of $1500. I was told an article will be uploaded with pictures... eventually. Will put it here if it ever happens.

Here are a few key snippets from the presentation we gave:
